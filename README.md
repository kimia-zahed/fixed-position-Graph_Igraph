# fixed-position-Graph_Igraph
In this code, you will see a fixed position graph that each node has an (x,y) coordinate &amp; a linking range (R) .
nodes that are in their range will be connected and we try to make the whole nodes connected with minimum energy consumption.
for working on graph, we used Igraph_python library
